  <h2>📜 Terms & Conditions</h2>

  <p>
    Medi-Time is provided as a personal medicine reminder tool.
    By using this application, you agree to the following terms and conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Usage:</strong><br />
    This app is intended only to remind users of medicine timings
    as entered by the user. It does not automatically determine
    medical schedules.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>No Medical Advice:</strong><br />
    Medi-Time does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
    Always follow instructions given by a qualified healthcare professional.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>User Responsibility:</strong><br />
    You are solely responsible for verifying medicine names, dosages,
    images, and schedules before relying on reminders.
    The developer is not responsible for missed, delayed, duplicate,
    or incorrect medication reminders.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Background & Notifications:</strong><br />
    Voice alarms and spoken reminders require the app to remain active
    in the background and not be restricted by battery optimization
    or system settings.<br /><br />
    If the app is closed, force-stopped, or restricted by the device,
    voice and alarm features may not function as expected.<br /><br />
    Notification reminders may still be delivered when the app is closed,
    depending on device support and permissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Availability:</strong><br />
    App functionality depends on your device, browser, operating system,
    permissions, and network availability.
    Continuous operation is not guaranteed on all devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Continued use of this app means you accept and agree to these terms.
  </p>
